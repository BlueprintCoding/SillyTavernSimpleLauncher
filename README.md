# SillyTavernSimpleLauncher
A GUI launcher that let's you install, uninstall, update, backup and uninstall SillyTavern and SillyTavernExtras

UPDATED README COMING SOON!

For now just use "Install STSL.ps1" for the first run/install. You may have to run it twice if you get errors. Right click and run in powershell. It will ask for admin permissions

After that just use "Start STSL.bat" to start the STSL.


## IF YOU PLAN ON USING INSTALLING AND USING EXTRAS READ THIS.

Extras requires visual studios build tools to be installed. 
Download this, install it. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
Then check this and install. Once that installs you'll need to delete your extras folder and install it again with the launcher.

I'll try to automate this in the future but I'm not positive it can be automatically installed.
